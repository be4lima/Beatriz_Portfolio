## [Project 1: Modelling and prediction of carbon-dioxide emissions by using ARIMA model](https://github.com/be4lima/ARIMA_CO2_BR)
**Languages**: Python

Develop an ARIMA model to forecast $CO_2$ emissions in Brazil using historical data and analyze the model's performance in predicting future values.

- Time Series Analysis: Conducted stationarity tests, decomposed time series, and applied differencing to achieve stationarity.
- Modeling with ARIMA: Used auto_arima to select optimal parameters, fitted the model to historical data, and performed residual analysis.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy using RMSE and MAPE, and validated predictions through a train-test split.
- Outcome: Demonstrated the ARIMA modelâ€™s effectiveness in forecasting CO2 emissions and identified areas for future enhancement, such as incorporating exogenous variables.

## [Project 3: Data Science applied to Environmental and Urban Engineering](https://be4lima.github.io/TG-Beatriz-Lima/) 
**Languages**: R and R Markdown

### [Modeling the relationship between deforestation and GHG emissions in the Brazilian Amazon using a linear regression model](https://be4lima.github.io/TG-Beatriz-Lima/aplica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-1.html)
- Data Collection & Cleaning: Acquired real-world data on deforestation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from INPE, cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the relationship between annual deforested area and first-order CO2 emissions, including data visualization to identify trends and correlations.
- Feature Engineering: Developed and selected relevant features to enhance model accuracy, focusing on the relationship between land use change and CO2 emissions.
- Model Implementation & Validation: Built a Linear Regression model, validated its assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality), and evaluated its performance using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### [Geospatial analysis of Fire spots in Brazilian forests](https://be4lima.github.io/TG-Beatriz-Lima/aplica%C3%A7%C3%B5es.html#pontos-de-inc%C3%AAndio-nas-florestas-brasileiras)
  - **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**: Collected and processed geospatial data on forest fire occurrences in Brazil, ensuring data quality for analysis.
  - **Geospatial Data Analysis**: Applied geospatial analysis techniques in R to identify and examine the distribution patterns of fire hotspots across Brazilian forests.
  - **Data Visualization**: Created detailed maps and visualizations to illustrate the concentration and spread of fire incidents, utilizing tools like `ggplot2`, `sf`, and `leaflet` in R.
  - **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted statistical tests to explore correlations between fire occurrences and various environmental factors.
