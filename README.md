## [Project 1: Modelling and prediction of carbon-dioxide emissions by using ARIMA model (Python)](https://github.com/be4lima/ARIMA_CO2_BR)
Develop an ARIMA model to forecast $CO_2$ emissions in Brazil using historical data and analyze the model's performance in predicting future values.

- Time Series Analysis: Conducted stationarity tests, decomposed time series, and applied differencing to achieve stationarity.
- Modeling with ARIMA: Used auto_arima to select optimal parameters, fitted the model to historical data, and performed residual analysis.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy using RMSE and MAPE, and validated predictions through a train-test split.
- Outcome: Demonstrated the ARIMA modelâ€™s effectiveness in forecasting CO2 emissions and identified areas for future enhancement, such as incorporating exogenous variables.
